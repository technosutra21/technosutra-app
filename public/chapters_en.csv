She has nothing but a single small pot, which proves to be an inexhaustible treasure of generosity. She is accompanied by ten thousand maidens with qualities of apsarās.","At first, ten thousand maidens who are emanations of her own practice. Later, countless beings from all ten directions, attracted by her past prayers, arrive to receive her offerings.","Prabhūtā explains to Sudhana that she, along with her entourage, shares the same conduct, merit, and aspiration. She describes how, from her small pot, she can feed and provide for all beings in the universe. She states that the food from her pot is so powerful that it allows śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas in their last life to reach their respective illuminations.","The liberation of the bodhisattva called ""the incessant display of the Treasury of Merit."" This teaching demonstrates the power of unlimited generosity, showing that the merit of a bodhisattva can manifest as an inexhaustible source that satisfies all the physical and spiritual needs of all beings without ever being depleted.","The main manifestation is the small pot. From this single container, Prabhūtā materializes any kind of food, drink, seat, clothing, jewelry, or other item desired to fully satisfy countless beings who come from all directions. The pot never empties. Additionally, the fragrances that emanate from her assistants pacify everyone's minds in the city, eliminating anger, greed, and jealousy.","Sudhana learns that the merit accumulated through generosity is truly inexhaustible and that external simplicity may contain unlimited internal power. He witnesses how active compassion not only relieves material suffering but also serves as a direct catalyst for the illumination of others.","Prabhūtā, like the others, admits that she only knows this portal of inexhaustible merit and directs Sudhana to his next guide, the householder Vidvān, in the city of Mahāsaṃbhava.","The contrast between the simple appearance (a young maiden with a small pot) and the infinite miraculous power. The pot as a symbol of the inexhaustible generosity of a bodhisattva. The direct connection between the act of giving (food) and the ability to lead others to final illumination."

He personifies generosity manifested through the power of mind and pure aspiration.","Thousands of petitioners of all origins that come to seek the help of Vidvān, as well as a sequino of five thousand musicians and ten thousand beings with superhuman qualities that serve and participate in the practice of generosity.","After Sudhana expresses her vast aspiration to benefit all beings, Vidvān praises him and then demonstrates his power. He meets the needs of all who come and then teach them Dharma in a way that relates directly to what they received. For example, to those who received food, he teaches about the ""food of wisdom""; To those who received carriages, he teaches about Mahāyāna, the ""great vehicle"".","The release of the bodhisattva called ""the merit that arises from the treasure of the mind."" This teaching demonstrates the power to manifest all material requirements directly from heaven, simply through the power of mind and aspiration. Vidvān uses this ability to meet the needs of all beings, and since his material needs are met, he teaches them the Dharma, adapting the message to guide them to illumination.","The main manifestation is Vidvān's power to materialize objects from the sky. By simply looking upward, he causes a rain of infinite varieties of foods, beverages, clothes, jewelry, and any other objects that approaching beings desire. These objects appear directly in their hands, simultaneously satisfying countless supplicants.","Sudhana learns that the generosity of a Bodhisattva is not limited by physical resources. Through the power of mind and merit, the ability to give is infinite. He also learns a skillful teaching method: first satisfy the worldly needs of beings to open their hearts and minds for spiritual teaching.","Vidvān humbly states that he knows this release only and cannot understand the conduct of the bodhisattvas which are like an ocean of merit. He directs Sudhana to the city of Siṃhapota to find his next guide, the patron of Dharma Ratnacūḍa.","The manifestation of material objects directly from heaven as a result of mental power and merit. The teaching method that directly connects the satisfaction of material needs with a corresponding spiritual teaching. The practice of generosity in a public and urban scenario (a crossroads)."

He represents wisdom that transcends age and form, demonstrating that realization can manifest in any being, and that worldly knowledge can be a portal for the transcendent.","Ten thousand children playing in the sand, along with devas, nāgas, yakṣas and gandharvas who watch from the heavens and guide Sudhana to the boy.","Indriyeśvara explains that it was Mañjuśrī himself who taught him writing and mathematics, allowing him to master all the arts and crafts. He then recites the long list of numerical names and uses this count to analyze the mound of sand and, by extension, the vastness of all kingdoms, kalpas, Buddhas and beings in ten directions.","The portal of wisdom called ""clairvoyance in all arts"". This teaching reveals that a Bodhisattva can master all forms of worldly knowledge-from mathematics and engineering to medicine and agriculture-and use them as a skillful means of guiding beings. The teaching culminates in a lesson on Bodhisattvas mathematics that expands the mind to conceive of infinity.","The main manifestation is the demonstration of the bodhisattvas' counting system. Indriyeśvara lists an exponential series of names for inconceivably large numbers (ayuta, niyuta, etc., up to anabhilāpyānabhilāpya). Then he applies this mathematics to calculate the exact number of sand grains in a gigantic hill, demonstrating the ability of his wisdom to encompass and measure the vastness of the universe.","Sudhana learns that wisdom is not limited to purely spiritual concepts, but can cover all areas of knowledge. The lesson on inconceivable mathematics radically expands its conception of infinity and its understanding of a bodhisattva mind of the mind of understanding the totality of existence.","Indriyeśway, humbly admits that you only know this portal of knowledge of all phenomena and cannot understand the conduct of more advanced Bodhisattvas. He then directs Sudhana to the city of Samudra-Pratiṣṭhāna to find Upāsikā (lay practitioner) Prabhūtā.","The use of a child like kalyāṇamitra. The integration of secular knowledge (mathematics, engineering, etc.) with spiritual wisdom. The long and impressive enumeration of inconceivable numbers as a teaching method to expand the mind."

Her presence is so pure that the house itself emanates a golden light that grants samādhis to Sudhana through simple contact. Her beauty and the fragrance of her body surpass those of all beings in the realms of desire, except for the buddhas and advanced bodhisattvas, and no being can look at her with desire.","Although it is in a domestic environment, its assembly is composed of beings that are attracted and purified by its simple presence. The scene emphasizes that realization can flourish in any context, not just in isolated monasteries.","In response to Sudhana's question, Acalā tells the story of her original aspiration and details how, by countless Kalpas, she maintained an immaculate practice, never forgetting a single teaching, never failing to practice a single Bodhisattva conduct and never diverting to lower vehicles. It demonstrates the power of its realization through a meditative vision.","Acalā teaches the liberation called ""the essence of wisdom difficult to achieve"" and the ""tireless pursuit of the Dharma."" Her central teaching is about the strength of an unwavering initial aspiration. She tells how, in a past life countless kalpas ago, the vision of Buddha Pralambabāhu inspired her to develop such a powerful motivation that since then she has never had a thought of desire, anger, or ego, not even in dreams or in the state between lives.","The main manifestation is its own purity, which transforms the environment and the beings around it. Upon entering samādhi, she reveals the countless Sudhana Buddic kingdoms and the succession of Buddhas, demonstrating the power of her purified mind. Its realization is not ostensive, but a demonstration of internal perfection that naturally radiates.","Sudhana learns about the power of continuity and purity in spiritual practice. Acalā is the embodiment of unshakable dedication throughout ages, showing that a single aspiration, when maintained with perfect purity, leads to an inconceivable achievement. He understands that true strength is not in external deeds, but in internal purity maintained over time.","Acalā humbly states that he only knows this release of wisdom difficult to reach and directs Sudhana to the land of Amitosala to find his next guide, Parivrājaka (wandering ascetic) Sarvagamin, moving the focus of wisdom cultivated in stability for that practiced in motion.","Transcendental purity in a common context: Acalā demonstrates the highest level of spiritual purity living in a family home, challenging the notion that realization requires imprisonment."

They are discussing civic duties, and Jayottama uses this opportunity to teach Dharma. It represents the figure of the enlightened social leader, which integrates civic responsibility with spiritual practice.","The assembly is multifaceted. Physically, he has thousands of heads of family. However, his true assembly is universal, composed of all beings in the countless kingdoms where he manifests himself, including devas, nāgas, humans, and even beings in infernal kingdoms, each receiving a teaching adapted to his condition.","After Sudhana introduces himself formally and expressing his vast aspirations, Jayottama explains his ubiquitous conduct. He details as Dharma teaches in multiple kingdoms of existence to eradicate suffering and guide beings away from non-virtuous actions. He teaches about the creation and destruction of the worlds, the defects of the Saṃsāra and the qualities of omniscience.","The portal for the ""omnipresent"" bodhisattva conduct. Jayottama is based on ""non-compound miracles based on the absence of existence,"" which allows him to be present and teach simultaneously in all kingdoms of existence. Its main teaching is the elimination of all forms of ego, possessiveness and attachment as the path to peace and social harmony.","The main manifestation is its omnipresence. While physically in the forest, he teaches simultaneously in heavenly parades, the worlds of the nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, and in all villages and cities of the human world. He pacifies conflicts, prevents wars, and guides all kinds of beings, from the debris to the black, perfectly adapting their teachings to each one.","Sudhana learns that civic responsibility and social leadership are not separated from spiritual practice, but they can be a powerful expression of it. He witnesses how a bodhisattva can use his wisdom to create harmony and guide an entire society, operating on a universal scale for everyone's benefit.","Jayottama, with humility, admits that his knowledge is limited to this portal of omnipresent conduct. He directs Sudhana to the city of Kaliṅgavana, in the land of śroṇāparānta, to find his next guide: Bhikṣuṇī (nun) SIṃha VijṛMBhitā, moving the focus of male secular leadership to female monastic life.","Civic Responsibility as a spiritual path: The chapter emphasizes the importance of social engagement and clarified leadership as a form of Bodhisattva practice."

He remains like this for six months and six days, while Sudhana watches him patiently. During this period, the body of the monk becomes the KALYANAMITRAenter of an extraordinary cosmic display of illuminated activity, emanating the ten perfections (pāramitās) of each part of his body.","The assembly is entirely visionary and multifaceted, emanating from Sāgaradhvaja's own body. Includes traders practicing generosity, wise kings, ṛṣis, nāgas, asuras, śrāvakas, and even emanations of suns, moons and their own Buddhas.","The dialogue occurs only after Sāgaradhvaja emerges from its six -month meditation. Sudhana, marvelously, asks Samādhi's name. Sāgaradhvaja explains that it is the ""perfection of wisdom called the complete view of the realization of equanimity"" and, like others, admits only to know this portal.","The release of the ""complete view of the realization of equanimity"". The teaching is not verbal, but a direct demonstration through its Samādhi. It manifests, from each part of his body, emanations that correspond to the practice and the result of the ten perfections, showing how the realization of a Bodhisattva actively benefits all beings.","This chapter contains one of the most elaborate descriptions of Sutra manifestations. Emanating from specific parts of the body of Sāgaradhvaja, Sudhana witnesses the ten perfections in action: generosity (dāna) of the feet, discipline (śīla) of the knees, patience (kṣānti) of the navel, diligence (vīrya) of the sides, meditation (dhyāna) of the chest, and so on, culminating with emanations of their bodies of TathāgataHead, raining Dharma over all.","Sudhana learns through direct observation how a single being manifests itself as a universal and multifaceted compassionate activity. The long duration of its observation symbolizes the patience and devotion necessary to understand the depth of the conduct of a Bodhisattva.","Sāgaradhvaja, when emerging, confirms the name of his practice, but humbly admits that he only knows this portal. He directs Sudhana to his next guide, the Upāsikā (lay practitioner) āśā, in the city of Mahāprabhāsa, in a land called Samudravetāḍī.","Specific body emanations: The detailed correlation between body parts and ten perfections is unique, transforming the body of the meditator into a cosmic mandala."

Sudhana finds him and asks a series of poetic questions about how a Bodhisattva advances on the way.","The Assembly is visionary, composed of mythological beings (nāgas, asuras, etc.) that reverence the cosmic lotus. After his realization, Sāgaramegha also teaches the beings of the ten directions that seek him.","Sudhana expresses her aspiration and asks poetic questions about Bodhisattva's journey. Sāgaramegha first praises Sudhana's motivation, describes the prerequisites for aspiration to enlightenment and then narrates the long contemplation of the ocean that culminated in her vision and receipt of the Dharma.","The release through the contemplation of vastness and the receipt of the Dharma. Sāgaramegha teaches the Dharma portal called ""Eyes that all see"" (All-Seeing Eyes), which was transmitted directly to a Tathāgata that came from a vision. This teaching is so vast that the whole ocean as ink would not be enough to write it.","The main manifestation is the vision of a gigantic jewelry lotus arising from the ocean, sustained by asuras and revered by a vast assembly of beings (nāgas, garuḍas, devas, etc.). In the center of the lotus, Sāgaramegha sees a body of Tathāgata, whose form extends to the summit of existence, which then conveys the teaching.","Sudhana learns that profound contemplation of nature can lead to transformative visions and direct receipt of teachings. He understands that even such a deep teaching is just a portal among many, reinforcing the vastness of the path of Bodhisattva.","Sāgaramegha, as well as his predecessor, recognizes the limitation of his knowledge. He states that he only knows this portal of Dharma and directs Sudhana to his next Kalyāṇamitra, the Bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita, who resides in Sāgaratīra, on the way to Laṅka.","Nature contemplation: the use of ocean contemplation as a method to open the mind to the vastness of Dharma."

Mañjuśrī, from a great distance, extends his hand and places it over Sudhana's head.","The meeting is a distance interaction between Mañjuśrī and Sudhana.","Dialogue is a monologue of Mañjuśrī. He praises Sudhana's perseverance and, by contrast, describes the failures that prevent others from achieving such realization. He then inspires him with a final blessing.","The teaching is a final encouragement. Mañjuśrī praises Sudhana, saying ""well done, well done!"", And explains that those with weak faith, tired minds, little diligence, or that they are not careful by kalyāṇamitras, would not be able to know the true nature of phenomena or enter the kind of path and field of activity that Sudhana experienced.","The main manifestation is the miraculous act of Mañjuśrī extend his arm by a distance of 110 Yojanas to touch Sudhana's head. After encouragement, he inspires Sudhana and possesses him with countless Dharma portals, blessing him with retention, eloquence, samādhi, superior cognitions and infinite wisdom.","This meeting acts as the final confirmation of Sudhana's journey. After receiving the culminating teaching of Maitreya, the blessing of his original guide, Mañjuśrī, seals his realization. It is established in the field of ""completely good conduct"" (the conduct of Samantabhadra), meaning that it is now ready for final practice.","There is no explicit direction with the formula ""go to ..."" Mañjuśrī simply inspires Sudhana, establishes it in the conduct of Samantabhadra, and then retreats, remaining in its own region. The transition is implicit: having been established in the conduct of Samantabhadra, the next and last logical step for Sudhana is to find Samantabhadra himself.","The touch at a distance: a unique miracle that demonstrates the power and ubiquitous presence of a large bodhisattva."

Supratihite explains in detail his release, the ""portal without impediments"", and how, from the realization of the ""presence without substance"", it manifests its miraculous powers to serve all Buddhas and guide beings.","The release of the ""Unimpeded Gateway) portal. The realization of supratiṣṭhita is the ""light of wisdom called the apex without impediments"", which is based on ""presence without substance"" and gives it uncomposed miraculous powers. This results in the total absence of obstacles to knowing the minds of all beings, the past and the future, and to travel and make offerings to all Buddhas in the universe at one moment.","The chapter is a spectacular demonstration of power: - Walk in heaven: supratiṣṭhita walks serenely in heaven.- Powers of transformation: It can become invisible, emanate fire, multiply your body, cross solid objects, and master the elements.- omnipresence: In a single mental moment, he travels to countless Buddic kingdoms in the ten directions to make offerings to all Buddhas simultaneously.","Sudhana learns that spiritual fulfillment completely transcends physical laws. He witnesses a level of power and freedom that demonstrates that for a bodhisattva performed there is no separation between kingdoms, and there are no limits to the ability to perceive reality and serve the Buddhas.","He humbly admits that he only knows this portal of liberation and cannot understand the conduct of Bodhisattvas with even wider achievements. He then directs Sudhana to his next Kalyāṇamitra: The Dravidian Megha in the city of Vajrapura in the land of Draviḍa.","Extreme miraculous powers: The chapter offers one of the most vivid and extensive descriptions of psychic powers (Siddhis) in Sutra."

Sudhana asks, and Muktāsāra responds by naming her release and her practice of seeking Dharma, before humbly declare herself unable to talk about the conduct of great Bodhisattvas.","Muktāsāra claims to know the release of Bodhisattva called ""The Display of Pure and Unimpeded Memory"". He adds that he continually seeks the Dharma at the Tathāgatas' feet in the ten directions.","No external manifestation is described in the text. The release is named, but its effects are not elaborated.","Sudhana learns that spiritual fulfillment can be found in people of ordinary crafts like a goldsmith. It also reunites the name of a liberation you've heard before (from Surendrābhā on Chapter 45), suggesting that the same achievements can be found and expressed by different masters.","Muktāsāra, claiming only this release, directs Sudhana to the forest next to the city to find a householder called Sucandra, who has a ""house that brights continuously.""","The master artisan: reinforces the theme that wisdom can be found in any profession, not just in monastic or divine contexts."

Ratnacūḍa narrates the story of his incense offering to the Buddha Anantaraśmidharmadhātusamalaṃkṛtadharmarma and his subsequent triple dedication of merit, explaining that this unique act was the seed for all his current achievements.","The release of Bodhisattva called ""The Unpaid Display of the Field of Prayer."" The central teaching is about the power of the dedication of merit. Ratnacūḍa explains that all his vast fortune and ability to teach Dharma have come from a single act of generosity in a past life - offering a grain of incense to a Buddha - which he then dedicated to three goals: see all Kalyāṇamitras, all Buddhas and all Bodhisattvas.","The ten -story house is the main manifestation.

They are not only passive listeners, but active participants who, after being illuminated by the Buddha light, manifest their own miraculous powers.","Samantabhadra first teaches in prose and then recites poetic verses to reinforce the ten points.

The central teaching of Māyādevī is that she, through the power of her prayers and her realization, serves as the mother of all bodhisattvas in their final existence, not just the Buddha Śākyamuni.
