He enters innumerable Samādhis, perceives oceans of Budic kingdoms, and his practice becomes the same as Samantabhadra and all Tathāgatas. The culmination of the teaching is the recitation of the famous ""Prayer for Completely Good Conduct"" (Bhadracarī-Praṇidhāna), a set of votes that encapsulate the totality of Mahāyāna practice, serving as a guide for all aspirants.","After being established in the conduct of Samantabhadra by Mañjuśrī, Sudhana, with a fully purified and focused mind, longing to see Samantabhadra.","Bodhisattva","Completely good","In Bodhimaṇḍa, before the Vairocana tathāgata.","Sudhana has great achievement and roots of merit, so there are ten events and ten lights that are omens of the appearance of Samantabhadra. Sudhana sees Samantabhadra sitting in front of Buddha, and sees a variety of miraculous events that manifest themselves from Samantabhadra's pores and Samantabhadra's activities in countless kingdoms and through time. As a result, he reaches ten practices of the perfection of knowledge. Then Samantabhadra and all those samantabhadras before each Buddha put their hands over Sudhana's head, and he gets great achievements.","56 SAMANTABHADRA AND ""THE PRAYER FOR Stem Array.pdf","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sh_OpQEZy2OLbkU2JHC2qN20VWY2SOnS/view?usp=drive_link","https://technosutra21.github.io/technosutra/?model=56","https://cdn.statically.io/gh/technosutra21/technosutra/master/modelo56.glb"
